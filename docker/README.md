# Running with Docker

This is a sample configuration for running Healthchecks with
[Docker](https://www.docker.com) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/).

Note: For the sake of simplicity, the sample configuration starts a single database
node and a single web server node, both on the same host. It does not handle TLS
termination.

## Getting Started

* Copy `/docker/.env.example` to `/docker/.env` and add your configuration in it.
  As a minimum, set the following fields:
    * `ALLOWED_HOSTS` – the domain name of your Healthchecks instance.
    Example: `ALLOWED_HOSTS=hc.example.org`.
    * `DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL` – the "From:" address for outbound emails.
    * `EMAIL_HOST` – the SMTP server.
    * `EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD` – the SMTP password.
    * `EMAIL_HOST_USER` – the SMTP username.
    * `SECRET_KEY` – secures HTTP sessions, set to a random value.
    * `SITE_ROOT` – The base public URL of your Healthchecks instance. Example:
    `SITE_ROOT=https://hc.example.org`.

* Create and start containers:

  ```sh
  docker-compose up
  ```

* Create a superuser:

  ```sh
  docker-compose run web /opt/healthchecks/manage.py createsuperuser
  ```

* Open [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000) in your browser and log in with
  the credentials from the previous step.

## uWSGI Configuration

The reference Dockerfile uses [uWSGI](https://uwsgi-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
as the WSGI server. You can configure uWSGI by setting `UWSGI_...` environment
variables in `docker/.env`. For example, to disable HTTP request logging, set:

    UWSGI_DISABLE_LOGGING=1

To adjust the number of uWSGI processes (for example, to save memory), set:

    UWSGI_PROCESSES=2

Read more about configuring uWSGI in [uWSGI documentation](https://uwsgi-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Configuration.html#environment-variables).

## SMTP Listener Configuration via `SMTPD_PORT`

Healthchecks comes with a `smtpd` management command, which runs a SMTP listener
service. With the command running, you can ping your checks by sending email messages
to `your-uuid-here@your-hc-domain.com` email addresses.

The container is configured to start the SMTP listener conditionally, based
on the value of the `SMTPD_PORT` environment value:

* If `SMTPD_PORT` environment variable is not set, the SMTP listener will not run.
* If `SMTPD_PORT` is set, the listener will run and listen on the specified port.
  You may also need to edit `docker-compose.yml` to expose the listening port
  (see the "ports" section under the "web" service in `docker-compose.yml`).

The conditional logic lives in uWSGI configuration file,
[uwsgi.ini](https://github.com/healthchecks/healthchecks/blob/master/docker/uwsgi.ini).

## TLS Termination

If you plan to expose your Healthchecks instance to the public internet, make sure you
put a TLS-terminating reverse proxy or load balancer in front of it.

**Important:** This Dockerfile uses uWSGI, which relies on the [X-Forwarded-Proto](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/X-Forwarded-Proto)
header to determine if a request is secure or not. Make sure your TLS-terminating
reverse proxy:

* Discards the `X-Forwarded-Proto` header sent by the end user.
* Sets the `X-Forwarded-Proto` header value to match the protocol of the original request
  ("http" or "https").

For example, in NGINX you can use the `$scheme` variable like so:

```
proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
```

## Pre-built Images

Pre-built Docker images, built from the Dockerfile in this directory, are available
[on Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/healthchecks/healthchecks). The images are
built automatically for every new release.

The Docker images:

* Support amd64, arm/v7 and arm64 architectures.
* Use uWSGI as the web server. uWSGI is configured to perform database migrations
  on startup, and to run `sendalerts`, `sendreports`, and `smtpd` in the background.
  You do not need to run them separately.
* Ship with both PostgreSQL and MySQL database drivers.
* Serve static files using the whitenoise library.
* Have the apprise library preinstalled.
* Do *not* handle TLS termination. In a production setup, you will want to put
  the Healthchecks container behind a reverse proxy or load balancer that handles TLS
  termination.

To use a pre-built image for Healthchecks version X.Y, in the `docker-compose.yml` file
replace the "build" section with:

```text
image: healthchecks/healthchecks:vX.Y
```
